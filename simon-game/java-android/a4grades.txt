## REQUIREMENTS

1. [2/2] Your app should have a welcome screen with game name, very brief game instructions, and some interface methods to start a game or change game settings.

2. [2/2] Starting the game means the game interface is displayed, changing game settings means a settings interface is displayed.

3. [2/2] The settings interface has a method to set the number of Simon buttons in the game (between 1 and 6) and a method to select among three levels of difficulty (“Easy”, “Normal”, and “Hard”: requirement 9 covers how difficulty level works).

4. [2/2] The game interface has at least a score, a place for player messages, and the Simon buttons.

5. [2/2] There’s a way to return from the settings or the game back to the welcome screen.

6. [2/2] The Simon buttons should be displayed in some visually balanced and pleasing way (e.g. good spacing, attractive colours, nice styles), regardless whether there’s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 buttons. They should be large enough to tap easily with a finger.

7. [2/2] The message in the game should tell the player what’s happening in the game state, when it’s their turn, if they just lost or won, etc.

8. [2/2] When the computer is playing the sequence, the buttons “flash” for a duration of time to indicate the pattern that the user needs to replicate.
You can choose what “flash” means, the important thing is the user can clearly see when a button is played in the sequence.

9. [2/2] The playback speed of the sequence is determined by the selected difficulty level. Also the sequence pattern length increases by 1 on each successfully completed round, and returns to 1 when the user loses.

10. [2/2] The player can tap on buttons only when it’s “their turn”. The buttons are not active when the sequence is played or when the game was just won or lost.

11. [2/2] The player loses when they don’t complete a sequence correctly. There should be clear feedback that they lost (a message, changes in colour, etc.). After losing the player can start a new game or return to the welcome screen to read the instructions again or change settings.

12. [2/2] If the player completes a sequence correctly, clear feedback indicates they won, and they can start another round. The score is also increased by 1.
